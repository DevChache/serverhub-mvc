If you modify any controller file while ServerHub running, check if your browser will show you the latest modifications. There will be no effect when you refresh the web pages. ServerHub loads and registers controllers when the application first starts. And it will never automatically update these files. Not like views and models, ServerHub always cache and renew cached content for them. So that ServerHub can be both fast and stable.
